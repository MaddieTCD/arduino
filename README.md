## arduino for CISII 
My work for the arduino lessons from year 2 CIS TCD.

When you've completed the labs and assignments, commit and push your
solution to GitHub. Be sure that you have moved to the repository
directory using `cd directory-name` before you issue these commands.

```
git add .
git commit -m "completed week 2 assignments"
git push
```
